## Guidelines

The GameManager.sk is the main script that functions as the lobby handler, leaderboard tracker, staff and player management, chat management. In the future, it might be broken into smaller files. All games will need to use essential functions from it.

Games must run their own checks to make sure they're the game being ran to prevent them having code ran when it's not that game. LavaRising.sk is a game that will be used but also an example of the standard.

The code you submit must be easily readable, functional, use the required functions from GameManager.sk, have no known bugs/exploits.
